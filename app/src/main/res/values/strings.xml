    <string name="sample_text">     A large dog with a silky coat that ranges from ivory to reddish,
        the golden retriever is instantly recognizable. His floppy ears and soft eyes frame a dark nose.
        This breed was originally bred to help duck hunters bring ducks back to the boat.
        To this day, these dogs are generally friendly with strangers and even-tempered with change.
        They tend to love water and fetch, qualities that come together to make them into the quintessential American dog.</string>
